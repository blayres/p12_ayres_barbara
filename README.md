### 3.1 Possible endpoints

This project includes four endpoints that you will be able to use: 

- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}` - retrieves information from a user. This first endpoint includes the user id, user information (first name, last name and age), the current day's score (todayScore) and key data (calorie, macronutrient, etc.).
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/activity` - retrieves a user's activity day by day with kilograms and calories.
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/average-sessions` - retrieves the average sessions of a user per day. The week starts on Monday.
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/performance` - retrieves a user's performance (energy, endurance, etc.).


**Warning, currently only two users have been mocked. They have userId 12 and 18 respectively.**

### 3.2 Examples of queries

- `http://localhost:3000/user/12/performance` - Retrieves the performance of the user with id 12
- `http://localhost:3000/user/18` - Retrieves user 18's main information.
